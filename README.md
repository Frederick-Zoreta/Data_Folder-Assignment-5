Overall Summary
The raw data set from Kaggle contains IBM's HR Data. 

The data set can be downloaded in either CSV or Excel formats. It has a total of 51, 486 rows and 35 columns.
Not all of these columns have any value to the overall analysis and presentation of the data set. 

Some of the key issues that were presented within this dta set were:

1. Having an overview of the entire data. This was done firstly with Excel and then SQL Server.
2. Data Transformation - creating several tables ( entities) such as: employee_sales, monthlyincome, attrition, dpeartment & jobsatisfaction
3. Data Aggregation - aggregating the data by creating 2 tables (entities) such as: attrition and none attrition. Also
 creating 3 statistics tables such as: avg_monthly income, min_monthly_income and max_monthly_income
4. Data Visualization - creating varios visualizations which provides further inisghts. A histogram and dashboard were used for the inisghts.
